Note:  These intructions will work regardless of whether U15 (Cypress CPLD) is stuffed, or U21 (Xilinx PLD) is stuffed.  If a part is not stuffed, solder jumps to pins directly to the bare pad instead. 

Terminology definitions
  pin:	IC pin soldered and pad, soldered together as normal. 
  leg:  IC pin that has been lifted, and is not connected to
	anything; it is floating in free air.
  pad:  Pad on PCB that does not have an IC pin or other part
	currently connected to it. 
  lift:	unsolder an IC pin and bend it upward to break the
	connection between pad and leg.
  jump:	solder a rework wire between two locations. 
	Gauge is not critical unless noted. 
  cut:	Use knife and solder iron to cut a small segment 
	out of a top-layer PCB trace, to break the connection.

12. Reprogram Cypress CPLD CY37032VP44-100AC, U15, with new ide.jed image (for pn 100-0018-03-C).  Relabel Cypress part U15 as "300-0055-02".
13. Label board rev as -C.
14. Test by loading functional test image, and run HDSTRESS and NET tests.
